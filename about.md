**NAZURUDEEN J.**

I'm a technical writer in, Tamil Nadu, India. I work at a leading hospitality industry based IT products company in the Technical communication department, focusing on our company's payment product.
In TechWritersNation.com blog, which focuses on technical writing, I will write about my learning and experiences on topics such as the following:

  * Design principles in technical writing
  * Information authoring
  * SDLC and DDLC
  * Agile methodologies
  * API documentation
  * Graphic Design
  * English grammar
  * Role of videos in the technical documentation space
  * Technical documentation Tools
  * Video Tools
  * Technical documentation careers

And many more...

My main interest focuses on writing in general and would like to discuss technical writing specifics later on.

## Were You Always a Technical Writer?

I have been working on many roles in my past, such as pre-sales, sales, business development, marketing, proposal writing, digital marketing, business analyst, graphic design, 3D animation, along with technical writing. This broad experience as a whole has made me a better technical writer, I guess. At the same time, I realize that there is a lot of learning to do in technical writing, which I would like to experiment with and share my knowledge with everyone. I believe in the principle of "The more I share, the more I get."
I found that I liked technical writing â€” a lot more than any writing types, as it is a mixture of interest in writing and technology fascination. After a tragic incident, I realized that it's better to focus on technical writing only and move up the technical documentation career ladder than concentrating on many other roles simultaneously. To my surprise, I found that there is more scope to learn in the IT industry as a technical writer and the pay scale is also good when you increase your skill-sets.

## What is my Educational Background?
I earned my mechanical engineering degree from Anna university. After my engineering, I pursued an M.B.A (in marketing) from Alagappa university when working in ICICI Bank as a business analyst.
My stint at ICICI made me realize that I have a real passion for technology, and I made the mistake of choosing an incorrect stream during my engineering. But, no regrets. Knowledge is always knowledge. Does education background matter in this internet world where all the information is free or low cost? I am glad to be in this technology-driven world and being a technical writer.

## Why do I want to write this blog?
I want to explore and expand my knowledge to go beyond my comfort zone. There is a lot of scope for improvement in the IT industry; I want to experiment and keep myself updated. I also do realize that there are a few basic concepts that I need to unlearn and relearn.
TechWritersNation.com is my personal blog, where I can make mistakes and learn new things from the mistakes I make.

For example, I owned a couple of WordPress websites. The loading speed was slow, and I started figuring out solutions for it and learned quite a few concepts to overcome the challenges. Then, I found that rather than hosting a WordPress website (which is mainstream), it is better to have static websites, and the loading speed is significantly less for static sites. At the same time, I can save money on hosting when you can host a website free of cost on GitHub with your domain name.

I can learn more concepts through blogging, like search engine optimization, git, github, programming, publishing on the web, the latest technology trends, etc.

I also have a desire to grow with writing. I believe that constant writing in blogs will make me search new topics, think and interrogate it from different perspectives, and sharing those views will make me a holistic writer.
